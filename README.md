# SAiDL-Spring-Assignment2025
This is my official submission of the Spring 2025 Induction Assignment for Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (SAiDL).
It consists of 2 tasks - 
1) Core ML (All flies related to it are under the Core ML folder)
2) Diffusion ( All flies related to it are under the Diffusion folder)

Through this I have learnt basic topics in the world of Machine Learning like convolutional neural networks, loss functions and even diffusion and hope to implement what I have learnt in the future.
